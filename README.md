Open Source Software Audit: VLC Media Player

Student: VAIBHAV JHA

Roll Number:24BCY10408

Course: Open Source Software (OSS)  

Project Overview
This repository serves as the practical documentation for my Open Source Software Audit project. For this assignment, I chose to audit **VLC Media Player**, a cornerstone of the FOSS community. The project explores the software's history (originating at École Centrale Paris), its licensing under the GNU GPL v2, and its technical footprint on a Linux system.

The goal was to move beyond just using the software and actually understand the "Four Freedoms" that govern its development and distribution.

System Environment
To conduct this audit, I utilized the following environment:
* Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (running via WSL2)
* Shell: GNU bash, version 5.2.21
* Audited Version: VLC media player 3.0.20 (Vetinari)

Shell Script Portfolio
I developed five specific Bash scripts to automate the auditing process. Each script addresses a different unit of the OSS syllabus:

1. script1.sh (System Identity): Automatically fetches the Linux kernel version and OS release to verify the audit environment.
2. script2.sh (Package Inspector): Checks if VLC is correctly installed via the `apt` package manager and locates its binary path.
3. script3.sh (Permission Auditor): Scans critical system directories to report on file permissions and disk usage.
4. script4.sh (Log Analyzer): A diagnostic tool that parses system logs for specific keywords like "error" or "warning."
5. script5.sh (OSS Manifesto): An interactive script that captures user reflections on software freedom and generates a formatted manifesto file.


How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/marutinandana12345-prog/oss-audit--24BCY10408-.git
   cd oss-audit--24BCY10408-

2. Make Scripts Executable  
    chmod +x *.sh  

3. Run Scripts  
    ./script1.sh  
    ./script2.sh  
    ./script3.sh  
    ./script4.sh  
    ./script5.sh

    
 Learning Outcomes  
- Understanding Linux system auditing  
- Hands-on experience with Bash scripting  
- Knowledge of package management (APT)  
- Log analysis and file permission handling  
- Deep understanding of Open Source principles  


Open Source Philosophy  
This project highlights the Four Freedoms of Open Source Software:  

1. Freedom to run the program  
2. Freedom to study how the program works  
3. Freedom to modify the program  
4. Freedom to distribute copies
